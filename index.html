        <h1>Bubbles</h1>
        <p class="bio">Bubbles is the youngest primary character, Julian and Ricky's closest friend, and the series'
            breakout character. In the first season, like most of the characters in the show, Bubbles maintains a
            somewhat-reserved demeanour to look good on camera. As the series progresses, he reveals many sides to his
            personality.</p>
        <p class="bio">Bubbles' full name is never revealed, and he is simply referred to by hospitals, courts, and
            other officials as "Bubbles." A Haligonian,[1] he is known for his hoarse Maritimer English, sensitive
            nature, pearl snap shirts, and thick glasses that magnify his eyes to a considerable degree. These glasses
            are likely due to aphakia, a condition where the lens in one's eye is missing and that is known for
            requiring glasses of that strength. Bubbles has never been seen without his glasses, even while sleeping,
            and in photographs of him as a child.</p>
        <p class="bio">Bubbles often acts as the Boys' conscience and tries to be the voice of reason during their
            misadventures. He is intelligent and has a larger general knowledge than most of the other residents,
            displaying knowledge of Greek philosophy, classical literature, as well as a strong interest in spaceflight
            and rocket science, which results in one special episode in which he and the Boys meet Canadian astronaut
            Commander Chris Hadfield and participate in a spaceflight training simulation. Bubbles regularly chastises
            Julian and Ricky for being "drunk and on drugs," although he also occasionally consumes marijuana and
            alcohol (the latter usually when he is depressed). Bubbles gets upset whenever Ricky and Julian fight and he
            is often forced to act as a peacemaker between the two in such scenarios. He also believes in (and harbors a
            fear of) Sasquatches (which he calls "samsquanches").</p>
